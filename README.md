# squadbot-hub

**IMPORTANT NOTE: Squadbot-hub will no longer be used in newer versions of squadbot. Instead there will be a restful package API in PHP, which is much cheaper to host and more efficient. We do not recommend to use Squadbot-Hub or make contributions to its code. - ABitOfSquad**

A central server to make the Squad Package Manager happen. Full of bugs, not able to run in production at this stage. 

We would appreciate if bugs would get reported using the Issue tracker on github!
